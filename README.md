# summer2020-5

This Repo is meant to showcase work I did over the summer of 2020, when I downloaded the student free trial of Tableau.

I taught myself how to use it from watching tutorials on Tableau's website, along with Youtube, and trial and error on my own.

The first data set I worked with was from Kaggle that consisted of college football data, I then created visualizations from it to learn more about the BIG 10 teams.
